					<h3>Freuently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><b>Meaning of a payday loan / Credit Loan ?</b></p>
<p>A payday loan or cash advance or credit loan is a small, unsecured, short-term cash loan typically backed by a future source of income, often times your next paycheck or other anticipated benefit. These loans should only be used when truly needed, such as in emergency financial situations. They are not a solution to long-term debt problems. Be sure you understand the risks of short-term cash loans and please borrow responsibly. If you are facing long-term financial difficulty, please consider credit counseling, education or other debt-management assistance such as nonprofit financial counseling services in your community.</p>
<p><b>How does usacreditlaon.com loan matching service work?</b></p>
<p>usacreditlaon.com is not a lender and does not make credit decisions. It simply connects interested consumers with independent, third party lenders based on the information provided. Begin by completing our simple form. Once submitted, usacreditlaon.com will try to connect you with an interested third party lender. Every third party lender has their own terms and conditions for payday loans (i.e., fees, repayment terms, renewal policies, APRs, etc.), and each makes approval decisions separately. If matched with an third party lender, be sure to fully understand the lender’s terms and conditions before agreeing to them. If you do not understand or agree to the lender’s terms and conditions, you may refuse the loan offer. If you have any questions or concerns about your payday loan, you should contact your lender directly.</p>

<p><b>What amount can be borrowed with a payday loan?</b></p>
<p>Typically, the amount that can be borrowed with a payday loan ranges between $100 and $1,000. Please note, however, not all lenders offer up to $1,000 and the amount offered by an interested lender may differ from the amount sought. How much you qualify for depends on numerous factors including your lender, income and employment. The fees and APR interest rates you will be charged for the loan are provided to you in a written document by the participating lender after acceptance of your application and before you are requested to digitally sign a loan agreement. You should review carefully before you are asked to sign. If a participating lender does not ultimately extend an application and loan to you, you will incur no cost whatsoever. Always print your loan documents and other paperwork for your records.</p>
<p><b>If approved for a payday loan by an independent third party lender, how quickly could I receive it?</b></p>
<p>An independent third party lender could transfer an approved payday loan to your bank account as early as the next business day. Please note, however, cash transfer times may vary depending on the lender and your individual financial institution.</p>

Please note that multiple inquiries on the three national databases (Equifax, Transunion and Experian) may result in a lowered credit score. By submitting your information you agree to allow third party providers to verify your information and check your credit as described in their policies and terms.</p>
<p><b>What should I ask my lender about renewal?</b></p>
<p>Participating lenders may have their own individual renewal policies, some of which may be automatic.

Know your state's loan renewal policies and review the lender's terms before agreeing.</p>
<p><b>What are the implications of late payments and non-payment?</b></p>
<p>Each lender has its own criteria, including, without limitation, additional fees, interest and collection costs. Be sure to inquire with your lender regarding late payments and/or non-payments, and otherwise read all of the loan terms, before you sign a loan agreement.</p>
