Loans from a state that has no limiting laws or loans from a bank not governed by state laws may have an even higher APR. The Annual Percentage Rate is the rate at which your loan accrues interest and is based upon the amount, cost and term of your loan, repayment amounts and timing of payments. Lenders are legally required to show you the APR and other terms of your loan before you execute a loan agreement.</p>

For details, questions or concerns regarding your loan please contact your lender directly. Only your lender can provide you with information about your specific loan terms, their current rates and charges, renewal, payments and the implications for non-payment or skipped payments. The registration information submitted by you on this website will be shared with one or more participating lenders. You are under no obligation to use our service to initiate contact with a lender, apply for credit or any loan product, or accept a loan from a participatign lender.

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Exclusions.</strong>Residents of some states may not be eligible for some or all short-term, small-dollar loans. The states serviced by this website may change from time to time, without notice. Credit Implications. The operator of this website does not make any credit decisions.

<p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Professional Advice.</strong>Loans provided by independent, participating lenders in our network are designed to provide cash to you to be repaid within a short amount of time. The short-term loans are not a solution for long-term debt and credit difficulties. Only borrow an amount that can be repaid on the date of your next pay period. Consider seeking professional advice regarding your financial needs, risks and alternatives to short-term loans.</p>
